Evil clerics can opt instead to compel the submission and service of these foul creatures. In either case, the cleric must do the following: Stand before the undead (within 30 feet); Speak boldly a commandment whilst displaying a holy symbol. The referee must cross-reference the cleric''s turning ability (TA) with the Undead Type to determine the cleric''s chance of success. Clerics of above-average charisma (15+) are more commanding; hence, their chance-in-twelve of success is improved by one (+1).'),

Materials vary: Some clerics engrave thin tablets of stone, whereas others use vellum or parchment, a fine quill, and sorcerer''s ink, such as sepia. This involved process requires one week per spell level and must be completed on consecrated ground, such as a shrine, fane, or temple.'),
