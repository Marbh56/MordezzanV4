('Turn Undead', 'All clerics can exert control over the undead and some d√¶monic beings, causing them to flee and/or cower. Evil clerics can opt instead to compel the submission and service of these foul creatures. In either case, the cleric must do the following: Stand before the undead (within 30 feet); Speak boldly a commandment whilst displaying a holy symbol. The referee must cross-reference the cleric''s turning ability (TA) with the Undead Type to determine the cleric''s chance of success. Clerics of above-average charisma (15+) are more commanding; hence, their chance-in-twelve of success is improved by one (+1).', 1),
