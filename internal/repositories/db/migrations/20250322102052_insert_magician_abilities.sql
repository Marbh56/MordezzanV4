('Alchemy', 'To practice the sorcery-science of alchemy. Apprentice magicians learn how to identify potions by taste alone; albeit the practice is not always safe. At 7th level, a magician may concoct potions with the assistance of an alchemist. By 11th level, the assistance of an alchemist is no longer required. For more information, refer to Chapter 7: Sorcery, alchemy.'),

('Familiar', 'To summon a small animal (bat, cat, owl, rat, raven, snake, etc.) of 1d3+1 hp to function as a familiar (singular creature with uncanny connexion to the sorcerer). Retaining a familiar provides the following benefits:
- Within range 120 (feet indoors, yards outdoors), the magician can see and hear through the animal; sight is narrowly focused, sounds reverberate metallically.
- The hit point total of the familiar is added to the magician''s total.
- The magician can memorize one extra spell of each available spell level per day (e.g., a 5th-level magician gains bonus level 1, 2, and 3 spells).
These benefits are lost if the familiar is rendered dead, unconscious, or out of range. The familiar is an extraordinary example of the species, has a perfect morale score (ML 12), and always attends and abides the will of its master. To summon a familiar, the magician must perform a series of rites and rituals for 24 hours. To determine result, roll 2d8 on the Familiars table.

If the familiar dies, the magician also sustains 3d6 hp damage. The magician cannot summon another familiar for 1d4+2 months.'),

('Read Magic', 'To decipher magical writings that otherwise are incomprehensible.'),

('Read Scrolls', 'To read a magician spell from a scroll and cast it once. This can be a spell not previously known.'),

('Enlist Henchmen', 'At 6th level, a magician may seek or be sought out by one or more henchmen, classed individuals (typically of similar class, race, and/or culture) who become loyal followers. For more information, see Chapter 8: Adventure, hirelings and henchmen.'),

('Craft Magic Items', 'At 11th level, a magician is capable of enchanting magic items for their own use. Even if a magician attains the prowess to craft such items, their knowledge of how to do so must be sought out or discovered, typically in grimoires, scrolls, or tomes of ancient lore; through tutelage by an archmage of like or greater level; or via divine inspiration.'),

('Lordship', 'At 11th level, a magician who builds or occupies a tower became a lord and is eligible to attract followers. More information is presented in Appendix B.'),

('Craft Magic Items for Others', 'At 15th level, a magician is capable of enchanting magic items for use by others. Even if the magician attains the prowess to craft such items, their knowledge of how to do so must be sought out or discovered, typically in grimoires, scrolls, or tomes of ancient lore; through tutelage by an archmage of like or greater level; or via divine inspiration.');
